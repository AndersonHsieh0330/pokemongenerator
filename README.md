This is a 3 day project for me to learn how to send API request in React.js and building my first simple website. Flex layout was a little hard to understand and work with, and the styles of each tag kinda makes it messy to keep track of. However it is a lot easier to build nice UI with React.js(CSS) than on Android. Had recently fell in love with APIs, it's so cool that so much information can be retrieved with a singal HTTPS link. I found that writing React.js code is very quick and definitely a lot easier to learn than native Android. Will probably go and learn how to create my own API later and also build my personal website with React.js. Building a website is quick and I like it, will also try to build a larger app with react native in the future. 

What I learned:
- Send API request with Axios and take care of JSON response
- Understand flex layout better
- Publish wesite with Github Pages
- More Git commands

Library and resources used: 
- [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) (Thank you to the creator! I loved it!)
- Axios
