This is an 3 day project for me to learn how to send API request in React.js. Had recently fell in love with APIs, it's so cool that so much information can be retrieved with a singal HTTPS link. I found that writing React.js code is very quick and definitely a lot easier to learn than native Android. Will probably go and learn how to create my own API later and also build my personal website with React.js. Building a website is quick and I like it, will also try to build a larger app with react native in the future. 

What I learned:
- Send API request with Axios and take care of JSON response
- Understand flex layout better
- Publish wesite with Github Pages
- More Git commands

Library and resources used: 
- Pokemon API: https://pokeapi.co/ (Thank you to the creator! I loved it!)
- Axios
